I used this program on 10.2 and 10.3 to read and write to scsi tapes. 
This is the last version - tuOSX0.8a1.
There were about 50 groups using it when my wedsite was closed down.
Interestingly the were several small special effect houses using it to move movies around.
It still worked on 10.3, but it was getting harder to use.
The README-tuOSX.rtf file contains the documentation.
It did work on the old versions of MacOSX. It actually generates the SCSI commands and 
mac system routines are just used to send the commands to the SCSI tape drive. In theory, 
it could be ported to other systems by replacing the send and receive routines.
hfstar is not needed on later versions of MacOSX. Its specical options have been included
in later versions of tar.
